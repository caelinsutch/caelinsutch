### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Caelin! Currently running [Cue](https://trycue.ai). We help teams build awesome AI-powered data experiences into their products to make analytics 10x more valuable for their customers. Previously worked as a fullstack software engineer and designer for various companies, and built / sold a previous startup [Plots](https://whatsplots.app).

Outside of startups, I'm interested in robotics (have contributed to several ROS2 packages), running (half and full marathons), and music (I play sax in a jazz / funk band). 

Wanna say hi? Shoot me an email - `caelin[at]trycue.ai`
