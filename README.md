### Hi there 👋

I'm Caelin! Working at the [National Design Studio](https://ndstudio.gov/) and exploring new ideas around AI-Human interaction

Before this, I was the founder of a venture backed startup called [Lookbk](https://www.lookbk.com) - which turns fashion creators into personal shopping agents for their fans from 2023-2025. Before that, I dropped out of Berkeley to build, launch, and eventually sell a startup building a vertical software platform for nightlife ([Plots](https://plots.events/)).

In between, I've spent a lot of time designing and building web and mobile applications or managing the teams that do for companies in almost every vertical from [ed-tech](https://tryplayground.com), [food robotics](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/mezli), [mar-tech](https://withsurface.com/), and [crypto](https://defillama.com/protocol/yeti-finance). 

When not working, you'll find me training for my next marathon, DJing, making cocktails, and cooking.
