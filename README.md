### Hi there 👋

I'm Caelin! Working at the [National Design Studio](https://ndstudio.gov/) and exploring new ideas around AI-Human interaction

Before this, I was the founder of a venture backed startup called [Lookbk](https://www.lookbk.com) - which turns fashion creators into personal shopping agents for their fans, and built, launched, and sold a startup building a vertical software platform for nightlife ([Plots](https://plots.events/)). \

Prior, spent a lot of time designing and building web and mobile applications or managing the teams that do for companies in almost every vertical from ed-tech, food robotics, and crypto. 

When not working, you'll find me training for my next marathon, DJing, and making great coffee.
