### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Caelin! Currently running [Cue](https://trycue.ai). We help teams deliver customized onboarding at scale. 

I previously built, launched, and sold a startup building a vertical software platform for nightlife ([Plots](https://plots.events/)). Prior, spent a lot of time contracting across various software verticals, everything from ed-tech, food robotics, and crytpo as a developer, designer, and product manager.

When not working late, you'll find me training for my next marathon, obsessing over public transit, and making great coffee (if you happen to be by Salesforce park our office has an espresso machine and would love to make you a cup). 

Wanna say hi? Shoot me an email - `caelin[at]trycue.ai`
