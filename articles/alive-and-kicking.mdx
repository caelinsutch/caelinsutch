description: 'What I believe in living for'

Writtin in the style of Marcus Aurelius' Meditations, this is a reminder to myself of what I believe in living for.

To Myself, In the Dark Hours

I. When anxious thoughts crowd my mind, I must remember what the gods have granted me to strive for. Not for fame, nor fleeting pleasures, but for what is true and noble in nature.

II. First and foremost: the divine gift of reason and choice. What separates us from beasts is not our desires, but our power to examine them and choose our path.

III. The body, this vessel of flesh, must be strengthened not for vanity but as an instrument of virtue. As a sword must be sharp to serve its purpose, so must the body be strong to serve the soul.

IV. On family: Nature commands us to procreate, but wisdom bids us to build more than mere bloodlines. Create a fortress of virtue and understanding that will outlast your mortal frame.

V. Commerce and enterprise - let them be pursued not for glory but as opportunities to create value and serve the common good. A successful business is merely a tool for practicing justice in the marketplace.

VI. Your influence on others - consider it as ripples in a pool. Act not for praise but from principle. The good you do without seeking recognition is the purest form of virtue.

VII. On travel and exotic foods - these are indifferent things. Yet through them, we may learn the unity of all peoples and the bounty of nature. Let such experiences teach wisdom, not feed mere pleasure.

IIX. Death - the final harbor toward which all ships sail. Accept it not with resignation but with understanding. It is the natural conclusion of all things, neither to be feared nor hastened.

IX. There is virtue in observing quietly, in being the wallflower. The wise man learns more from watching than from speaking. Let others chase the spotlight while you pursue understanding.

X. In friendships and love, remember: we are made for cooperation, like hands, like feet, like eyelids. To act against one another is contrary to nature. Cultivate relationships not for advantage but for mutual growth in virtue.

XI. Above all, be a true friend - first to yourself, then to others. For how can one give what one does not possess? Practice justice, temperance, courage, and wisdom. These alone are the worthy aims of existence.
